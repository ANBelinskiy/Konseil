                            A coach will help you with setting new goals and changing or adjusting old ones. After all, as it can happen : we strive for alien goals imposed on us from outside. But the achievement of them brings neither success nor satisfaction.<br><br>
                            To understand what you really want, what your real goals are – is one of the most difficult personal tasks of each person and one of the primary goal of coaching.<br><br>
                            Moreover, for a coach it does not matter in which area of life these tasks take place (types of coaching are different): business, career, personal life, hobbies or something else.<br><br> Also the goal of coaching is to help the client develop competences and eliminate restrictions to achieve meaningful and sustainable changes in the professional and personal spheres of life.

                                The goal (request) for a coach meeting is determined and then with the help of a system of questions, various techniques and tools the coach helps a person to achieve the goal, the desired result.

                                A coach is a consultant and trainer at the same time, who helps to eliminate psychological problems with the help of coaching technology and helps to improve performance in achieving goals, efficiency and life quality in any of the areas (career, finances, family, relationships, health, personal development).

                                Professional coaching uses a range of communication skills (such as targeted restatements, listening, questioning, clarifying etc.) to help clients shift their perspectives and thereby discover different approaches to achieve their goals.

                                        Coaching is a new direction of psychological counseling, based on the psychology of optimism and success. The philosophy of coaching is based on the principle that every person is able to BE, DO and HAVE whatever he wishes. The coach does not give advice and hard recommendations, but seeks a solution to the problems together with the client and encourages him to make independent conclusions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Good coaches believe that the individual always has the answer to their own problems but understands that they may need help to find the answer.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Coaching differs from psychological counseling by motivation.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Psychological counseling and psychotherapy are aimed at getting rid of any symptom, but working with a coach implies the achievement of a certain goal, new positively formulated results in life and work.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The difference between coaching and all types of counseling is the realization of the potential of the client himself under the coach guidance.
                                        <br><br>
                                        After all, the potential of each person has no limits and the task of the coach is to help the client to open it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        According to the training format, coaching can be offline and online (via telephone and the Internet), and by the number of participants - individual and corporate.

                                        Individual coaching is used to develop top managers and company executives, support managers in adapting to new positions, and accelerating the development of talented employees.
